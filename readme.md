  This file contains translation of data types and interfaces taken from the
  "Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.22621.0\um" SDK library

  There are no guarantees of the identity of the translation of built-in data types.

  As the library is used, it is planned to conduct regular testing and fix any errors found.

  There are no restrictions on the use of this material. Everyone can do with it what they want.
  
  The library has been named D2D1Ext. The second file D2D1ExtHelpers is optional and contains only the help functions.

  Included files:
    DocumentTarget.h
